## Layout

For reference, see the ["Screenshots" section](#screenshots) below.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:
* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page, on a sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * The plot/visualization for the selected comparison.
  * A title, a header, and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  * The same sidebar as the landing page, with the current plot highlighted with a blue outline. 
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The website also, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
